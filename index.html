            <h3>Recipes Book</h3>
            <p>Developed a comprehensive recipe Android app that provides access to over
                300,000 recipes through a robust API. The app includes features such as recipe
                management, allowing users to create, share, save and manage their own recipes, and
                pantry management to help users track and manage ingredients on hand and many more
                features. For secure and seamless access, I implemented OAuth authentication and
                Google sign-in. The app efficiently utilizes Firebase integration, with FireStore for
                NoSQL data storage, Firebase Storage for file management and storage , and Firebase
                Authentication for user management. Additionally, I integrated SQLite for local data
                persistence and offline access, and designed a user-friendly, responsive UI for an optimal
                experience across various devices. The app also have the Google Admob implemented for
                In-App Monetization from the ads. It also includes advanced sharing features, enabling
                users to share recipes across platforms like WhatsApp, Gmail, Messages, Instagram, and
                Telegram.
            
                Technologies used in this project include Kotlin MVVM, Retrofit, Firebase Firestore, Firebase
                Storage, Firebase Authentication, SQLite, OAuth, Google Sign-In, Google Admob and
                Glide, RetroFit , Okhttp etc .</p>
